Description: Run perl test scripts with statistics
DescPackaging: <<
 An essential package in 10.2-gcc3.3 and earlier so that the fink test
 suite can be run.  Not needed in 10.3 and later since it is included
 in perl 5.8.x.  However, a (non-essential) version of this  package
 should be left in the tree for the benefit of folks upgrading from
 earlier versions.
