2001-04-03  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* fink: Added code to become root automatically and to setup a
	suitable environment (PATH, umask).

2001-03-31  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* fink: Removed dead code, added qualifiers to import list.

2001-03-29  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* init.sh.in, init.csh.in: Removed LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH - they are not needed as the library paths are
	hardcoded into libraries and executables.

	* README: Updated with info on Mac OS X Final / Darwin 1.3.

2001-03-05  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* init.sh.in, init.csh.in: Removed
	BASEPATH/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin1.2 from PATH. The tetex package
	has been updated to put binaries in BASEPATH/bin.

	* fink: Added a check to avoid a warning when no parameters are
	passed.

2001-02-27  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* init.sh.in, init.csh.in: Added
	BASEPATH/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin1.2 to PATH. This needed for the
	current tetex package. It will probably break on Mac OS X Final
	and I hope to remove this again when the tetex package is revised
	to put all binaries in BASEPATH/bin.

2001-02-24  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* fink: Added code to display the version number and quit when -v
	or --version (or similar) is passed.

2001-02-23  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* upgrade.sh: Added code to create some directories that should be
	real directories.
	* install.sh: Added directories to be created as real directories
	on installation.

2001-02-18  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Released version 0.1.5. Started using CVS and ChangeLogs.
