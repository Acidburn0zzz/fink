 Fink 0.2.1 Installation
=========================

These are the installation instructions for Fink version 0.2.1. This
document covers three procedures:

 * First time installation
 * Upgrading from Fink 0.2.x
 * Upgrading from Fink 0.1.x


 First Time Installation
=========================

 Requirements
--------------
You need:
 * An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.0 or later. Darwin 1.3.1
   should also work, but this has not been tested. Earlier versions of
   both will _not_ work.
 * Development tools. On Mac OS X, install the Developer.pkg package
   from the Developer Tools CD. On Darwin, the tools should be present
   in the default install.
 * Many other things that come with Mac OS X. This includes perl 5.6,
   wget and autoconf.
 * Internet access. All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.
 * Patience. Compiling several big packages takes time. I'm talking
   hours here.


 Choosing A Directory
----------------------
Before you install, you must decide where Fink's directory hierarchy
will live. The recommended place is /sw, and all examples in this
document will use that. Any other directory should be fine as well, as
long as you don't use existing directories like /usr/local or
/usr. The bootstrap script tries to catch these.

A special note about /usr/local: While it is possible to install Fink
in /usr/local (and the bootstrap script will let you do that after a
confirmation), it is a bad idea. Many third party software packages
install into /usr/local. This can cause severe problems for Fink,
including overwriting files, dpkg refusing to install packages and
strange build errors. Also, the /usr/local hierarchy is in the default
search path for the shell and the compiler. That means that it is much
more difficult to get back to a working system when things break. You
have been warned.


 Installation
--------------
The actual installation is performed by the perl script
bootstrap.pl. It is accompanied by a small shell script, bootstrap.sh,
which checks some basic requirements and then hands over control to
the perl script. So, to start installation, run this command:

   ./bootstrap.sh

After running some tests, the script will ask you what method should
be used to gain root privileges. The most useful choice is 'sudo'. On
a default install of Mac OS X, sudo is already enabled for the user
account created during installation. The script will immediately use
the method you choose to become root. This is required for the
installation.

Next, the script will ask you for the installation path. See
'Choosing A Directory' above for hints about this. The script will
create the directory and set it up for the bootstrap that will be done
later.

Next up is Fink configuration. This consists mainly of selecting
mirror sites for downloading.

Finally, the script has enough information to conduct the bootstrap
process. That means it will now download, build and install some
essential packages. Don't worry if you see some packages being
compiled twice. This is required because to build a binary package of
the package manager, you must have the package manager available.


 Upgrading From Fink 0.2.x
===========================

If you already have Fink 0.2.x installed, you can update your
installation to 0.2.1 with this package.

Actually, there are two pieces that are updated independently: the
package manager and the package descriptions. It is recommended to
update the package manager first.


 Updating The Package Manager
------------------------------
To update the package manager, run the inject.pl script in this
directory, like this:

  ./inject.pl

It will try to locate your Fink installation automatically. If it
can't find it, you can pass the path as a parameter, like this:

  ./inject.pl /sw

The script copies the package descriptions into the appropriate
directory, creates tarballs in /sw/src and then runs fink to install
the new versions of the fink and base-files packages.


 Updating The Package Descriptions
-----------------------------------
If you downloaded the fink-0.2.1-full tarball, the package
descriptions are in the subdirectory pkginfo. To install them, run the
inject.pl script in that directory:

  cd pkginfo
  ./inject.pl

This inject.pl script works just like the one for the package
manager.

You can also grab the package descriptions as a separate tarball,
packages-0.2.1. If you did that, just unpack it and run the inject.pl
script inside.


 Updating Packages
-------------------
The above two steps will not update the actual packages, they only
provide you with the means to do so. The easiest way to get the new
packages is to use the 'update-all' command:

  fink update-all

This will bring all installed packages to the latest version. If you
don't want to do this (it may take some time), you can update
individual packages with the 'update' command. But note that some
package require specific versions of the packages they depend
upon. Fink currently has no way to enforce this, so you may run into
problems.


 Upgrading From Fink 0.1.x
===========================

There is no direct upgrade path from Fink 0.1.x to Fink 0.2.x, because
they use different methods for underlying package management (stow
vs. dpkg). The only way to upgrade is to do a complete reinstall. The
procedure is as follows:

 * Save any changes you have made to configuration files etc.
 * Save a list of packages you had installed. Hint: Try
   'ls /sw/var/fink-stamp'.
 * If you have the source tarballs still lying around in /sw/src and
   don't want to download them again, move them to another directory.
 * Wipe out the /sw directory, i.e. 'cd / ; rm -rf /sw'. Do this as
   root if neccessary.
 * Follow the procedures for a first time installation above.
 * When you're asked for an 'additional directory for downloaded
   tarballs', enter the directory you moved the tarballs to.
 * Reinstall the packages you need.


EOF.
