Changes since Fink 0.16.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* mirror updates
* lots of test suite work and cleanup
* many info file validation updates
* make error messages more understandable
* ability to fallback on rsync mirrors (also, better detection of
  out-of-date rsync mirrors)
* fixed a number of version corner cases (perl version handling,
  package epochs, etc.)
* fink-prebinding no longer sets the LD_* prebinding variables in the
  user's environment
* selfupdate-rsync should now work with (well, in spite of) rsync-hfs
* system-xfree86 virtual now complains if you're missing the SDK
  (since most fink usage of external X11 will require it)
* On Mac OS X 10.3 packages using an old (1.3.5-based) libtool can
  now be compiled twolevel
