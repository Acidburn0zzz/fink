 Fink 0.1.5
============

This is Fink, a package management system that aims to bring the full
world of GNU and other common Open Source software to Darwin and
Mac OS X.

With the help of GNU stow, it maintains a separate directory
hierarchy. It downloads original source releases, patches them if
neccessary, configures them for Darwin and compiles and installs
them. The information about available packages and the neccessary
patches are included with this distribution, everything else is
downloaded off the 'net.

This is version 0.1.5, an early development release. It has rough
edges everywhere, and some things don't work yet. Also, the list of
packages is quite short. You're walking on thin ground. It could easily
break your system (although it hasn't broken mine to date). You have
been warned.

Fink is released under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. See the file COPYING for details.


 Requirements
--------------
You need:
 * An installed Mac OS X (Public Beta) system. Darwin may also work,
   but I haven't had the chance to test it yet.
 * Development tools. On Mac OS X, grab Apple's Development Tools
   package from <http://developer.apple.com>. The Darwin tools may
   also work.
 * Many other things that come with Mac OS X. This includes perl 5.6,
   wget and autoconf.
 * Internet access. All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.


 Installation
--------------
First, you must decide where Fink's directory hierarchy will live. I
recommend /sw, because that's what I'm using. Theoretically, anything
should be fine, but don't use common, existing directories like
/usr/local or even /usr - that _will_ break your system.

This version of Fink comes with a small installation script,
install.sh. It takes the installation base path as the first
argument. To install Fink in the recommended location, type:

   ./install.sh /sw

The script will create the neccessary directories and copy the files
there. Then, it will run Fink and let it bootstrap itself. This
includes an interactive configuration, mirror selection and the
installation of essential packages (currently the stow package).


 Upgrading from previous releases
----------------------------------
You can upgrade from release 0.1.2 and later by using the upgrade.sh
script. It is called like the install.sh script, with the installation
path as the first (and only) parameter, e.g.:

   ./upgrade.sh /sw

Upgrading from releases prior to 0.1.2 is not possible. Sorry, too
much has changed.

To update all packages to the latest version use the 'update-all'
command (see below).


 Using Fink
------------
Fink has several commands that work on packages. All of them need at
least one package name, and all can handle several package names at
once. You can specify just the package name, or a fully qualified name
with a version number (e.g. stow-1.3.2 or stow-1.3.2-1).

To download, configure, build and install a package, type:

  fink install <package-name>...

This will also download and install any dependencies that are not yet
installed. The three major phases of the installation process can be
executed separately:

  fink fetch <package-name>...
    - download the source tarball
  fink build <package-name>...
    - configure and compile the package, install it in it's stow
      directory
  fink activate <package-name>...
    - link the package into the main tree

If you no longer want to use a package, you can remove it from the
main tree with:

  fink deactivate <package-name>...

Note that this just removes the symlinks that point into the
package's stow directory. It will still use disk space.

To update a package, type:

  fink update <package-name>...

This was introduced in version 0.1.4 and is almost identical to the
install command. Note that only the packages you specify in the
command will be updated, not the dependencies. If the newest version
of the package is already installed, nothing will be done. To
re-install a package, you must 'deactivate' it first.

To update all installed packages, type:

  fink update-all

This is identical to an 'update' command with all installed packages
as parameters.


 Using the Hierarchy
---------------------
To use the software installed in Fink's directory hierarchy, you must
set your PATH environment variable (and some others)
accordingly. Shell scripts are provided to do this for you. If you use
tcsh or csh, add the following to your .cshrc:

  source /sw/bin/init.csh

If you use sh or bash, you can call init.sh in the same location from
the appropriate shell startup file.
