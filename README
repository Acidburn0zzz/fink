 Fink 0.2.0
============

This is Fink, a package management system that aims to bring the full
world of GNU and other common Open Source software to Darwin and
Mac OS X.

With the help of dpkg, it maintains a separate directory hierarchy. It
downloads original source releases, patches them if neccessary,
configures them for Darwin and compiles and installs them. The
information about available packages and the neccessary patches are
included with this distribution, everything else is downloaded off the
'net.

This is version 0.2.0, an early development release. It has rough
edges everywhere, and some things don't work yet. Also, the list of
packages is quite short. You're walking on thin ground. It could easily
break your system (although it hasn't broken mine to date). You have
been warned.

Fink is released under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. See the file COPYING for details.


 Requirements
--------------
You need:
 * An installed Mac OS X, version 10.0 system. Darwin 1.3.1 should
   also work, but this has not been tested.
 * Development tools. On Mac OS X, install the Developer.pkg package
   from the Developer Tools CD. On Darwin, the tools should be present
   in the default install.
 * Many other things that come with Mac OS X. This includes perl 5.6,
   wget and autoconf.
 * Internet access. All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.


 Installation
--------------
The installation process is described in detail in the file
INSTALL. Please read it first, the process is non-trivial.


 Using Fink
------------
Fink has several commands that work on packages. All of them need at
least one package name, and all can handle several package names at
once. You can specify just the package name, or a fully qualified name
with a version number (e.g. stow-1.3.2 or stow-1.3.2-1).

To download, configure, build and install a package, type:

  fink install <package-name>...

This will also download and install any dependencies that are not yet
installed. The three major phases of the installation process can be
executed separately:

  fink fetch <package-name>...
    - download the source tarball
  fink build <package-name>...
    - configure and compile the package, create a binary package
      file (.deb)
  fink activate <package-name>...
    - install the binary package file

If you no longer want to use a package, you can remove it from the
main tree with:

  fink remove <package-name>...

This will remove the package's files, but leave the .deb, so you can
easily re-install it at a later time. If you need the disk space, you
can remove the .deb from the /sw/fink/dists tree.

To update a package, simply ask fink to install it - it will always
pick the latest version. You can also use the 'update' command, but
that is just an alias for the 'install' command. To update all
installed packages, type:

  fink update-all

This is identical to an 'update' command with all installed packages
as parameters.


 Using the Hierarchy
---------------------
To use the software installed in Fink's directory hierarchy, you must
set your PATH environment variable (and some others)
accordingly. Shell scripts are provided to do this for you. If you use
tcsh or csh, add the following to your .cshrc:

  source /sw/bin/init.csh

If you use sh or bash, you can call init.sh in the same location from
the appropriate shell startup file.


 Staying Informed
------------------
To be informed of new releases, go to
<http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fink-announce> and
subscribe yourself to the fink-announce mailing list. The list is
moderated and low-traffic.

To get help or just chat with other Fink users, subscribe to the
fink-users mailing list at
<http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fink-users>.

The project's website is at <http://fink.sourceforge.net>.
