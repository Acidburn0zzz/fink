 Fink 0.2.2
============

This is Fink, a package management system that aims to bring the full
world of GNU and other common Open Source software to Darwin and
Mac OS X.

With the help of dpkg, it maintains a separate directory hierarchy. It
downloads original source releases, patches them if neccessary,
configures them for Darwin and compiles and installs them. The
information about available packages and the neccessary patches are
included with this distribution, everything else is downloaded off the
Internet.

This is version 0.2.2, a development release. It has rough edges
everywhere, and lacks lots of useful features. The package list is
also quite short. You're walking on thin ground. It could easily break
your system (although it hasn't broken mine to date). You have been
warned.

Fink is released under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. See the file COPYING for details.


 Requirements
--------------
You need:
 * An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.0 or later. Darwin 1.3.1
   should also work, but this has not been tested. Earlier versions of
   both will _not_ work.
 * Development tools. On Mac OS X, install the Developer.pkg package
   from the Developer Tools CD. On Darwin, the tools should be present
   in the default install.
 * Many other things that come with Mac OS X. This includes perl 5.6,
   wget and autoconf.
 * Internet access. All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.
 * Patience. Compiling several big packages takes time. I'm talking
   hours or even days here.


 Installation
--------------
The installation process is described in detail in the file
INSTALL. Please read it first, the process is non-trivial.


 Using Fink
------------
The file USAGE describes how to set your paths and how to install and
remove packages. It also has a complete list of available commands.
