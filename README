 Fink 0.2.6 ReadMe
===================

This is Fink, a package management system that aims to bring the full world
of Open Source software to Darwin and Mac OS X.

With the help of dpkg, it maintains a separate directory hierarchy. It
downloads original source releases, patches them if neccessary, configures
them for Darwin and compiles and installs them. The information about
available packages and the neccessary patches are included with this
distribution, everything else is downloaded off the Internet.

This is version 0.2.6, a development release. It has rough edges everywhere,
and lacks lots of useful features. The package list is also quite short.
You're walking on thin ground. Read the instructions carefully. You have
been warned.

Fink is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. See the
file COPYING for details.


 Requirements
--------------
You need:

 * An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.0 or later. (There may still be
   some stray linker-related problems with 10.1.) Darwin 1.3.1 should also
   work, but this has not been tested. Earlier versions of both will _not_
   work.

 * Development tools. On Mac OS X, install the Developer.pkg package from
   the Developer Tools CD. On Darwin, the tools should be present in the
   default install.

 * Many other things that come with Mac OS X and the Developer Tools. This
   includes perl 5.6 and either wget or curl.

 * Internet access. All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.

 * Patience. Compiling several big packages takes time. I'm talking hours or
   even days here.


 Installation
--------------
The installation process is described in detail in the file INSTALL. Please
read it first, the process is non-trivial. It also describes the upgrade
procedure.


 Using Fink
------------
The file USAGE describes how to set your paths and how to install and remove
packages. It also has a complete list of available commands.
