[...] Here's them, roughly:

* tabs are 4 wide
* use tabs for indention of statements (so with the above, you get "4 
character indention")
* in particular, do *not* use emacs 2/8 indention mode
* don't use tabs for indention/alignment *inside* statements.
* there is no particular reason to stick to a 80 column width, but if 
it makes you feel better, I don't mind it either, as long as it doesn't 
cause extremely unnatural code formatting
* our bracing style is:
   while (foo) {
   	...
   }
* use a whitespace after keywords:  "if (foo)" and not "if(foo)"

Also, all perl code should be clean under "-w" and "strict"
standards. A typical perl script would thus begin:

  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
  # -*- mode: Perl; tab-width: 4; -*-
  # vim: ts=4 sw=4 noet
  use strict;
