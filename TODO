Minor
=====

* make sure the man pages are complete and up-to-date

* validator should error if a field is there more than once
  (done in parent, not yet in splitoffs).

* long validator wishlist in Validation.pm

Medium
======

* replace "fink list --help" by a general "fink --help [command]" similiar to 
  how CVS does it (e.g. try "cvs -H update")

* checksums should always be checked whenever we know we are going to use a given
  source file later. E.g. if you run "fink rebuild foo", then Fink does check 
  if the source files for package foo are present, and if not, downloads them.
  If present, fink should verify the checksum *immediatly*, in addition to the
  current check (just prior to decompressing the archive).

* add a mirror check utillity that given some testcases will verify that all mirrors
  do still work

Major
=====
* rewrite the dependency code
  -> added Conflicts / BuildConflicts support

* rewrite indexing code: dmalloc and dmacks in #fink said:
  Currently we scrap the DB and rebuild from scratch.
  Read current DB and then Only process "new" .info files; merge and save.
  'fink index -f' to really rebuild the whole thing.
