======

* checksums should always be checked whenever we know we are going to use a given
  source file later. E.g. if you run "fink rebuild foo", then Fink does check 
  if the source files for package foo are present, and if not, downloads them.
  If present, fink should verify the checksum *immediatly, not when the build
  is actually starting

* seperate the "mirror" list into its own package (either by putting it into 
  "base-files" or by creating a "mirror" CVS module & package)
  -> this allows us to quickly update the mirror list, should it be necessary

* add a mirror check utillity that given some testcases will verify that all mirrors
  do still work

* possibly get rid of the ncurses package on 10.2, by providing a system-ncurses
  package that just symlinks the ncurses dylibs in /usr/lib to /sw/lib
  (this is necessary at least for now to ensure backwards compatibility)

Major
=====
* rewrite the dependency code
  -> added Conflicts / BuildConflicts support
