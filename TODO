* seperate the "mirror" list into its own package (either by putting it into 
  "base-files" or by creating a "mirror" CVS module & package)
  -> this allows us to quickly update the mirror list, should it be necessary

* possibly get rid of the ncurses package on 10.2, by providing a system-ncurses
  package that just symlinks the ncurses dylibs in /usr/lib to /sw/lib
  (this is necessary at least for now to ensure backwards compatibility)

* add epoch support
* rewrite the dependency code
  -> added Conflicts / BuildConflicts support
