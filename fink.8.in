.SH NAME
fink \- a package management system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fink
.I command
.B [
.I package
.B ]
.\"
.\"
.\" DESCRIPTION
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fink
is a package management system that aims to bring the full world
of GNU and other common Open Source software to Darwin and Mac OS X.

With the help of
.BR dpkg (8),
it maintains a separate directory hierarchy. It
downloads original source releases, patches them if neccessary, configures
them for Darwin and compiles and installs them. The information about
available packages and the neccessary patches are included with this
distribution, everything else is downloaded off the Internet.

.\" COMMANDS
.\"
.\"
.SH COMMANDS
.B fink
has several commands that work on packages. All of them need at least
one package name, and all can handle several package names at once. You can
specify just the package name (e.g. gimp), or a fully qualified name with a
version number (e.g. gimp-1.2.1 or gimp-1.2.1-3). Fink will automatically
choose the latest available version and revision when they are not
specified.
.\"
.\"
.TP
\fBfink install\fP \fIpackage\fP\|.\|.\|.
The install command is used to install packages. It downloads, configure,
builds and installs the packages you name. It will also install required
dependencies automatically, but will ask you for confirmation before it does
so.

Aliases:
.BR update ", " enable ", " activate ", "
.BR use "."
.\"
.\"
.TP
\fBfink remove\fP \fIpackage\fP\|.\|.\|.
The remove command removes packages from the system by calling 'dpkg
--remove'. The current implementation has several fundamental flaws. It only
works on packages Fink knows about (i.e. .info file is present). It doesn't
check dependencies. It makes one dpkg invocation per packages, thus not
allowing dpkg to reorder according to dependencies.

The remove command only removes the actual package files, but leaves the .deb
compressed package file intact. This means that you can re-install the
package later without going through the compile process again. If you need
the disk space, you can remove the .deb from the @PREFIX@/fink/dists tree.

Aliases:
.BR disable ", " deactivate ", " unuse ", "
.BR delete ", " purge "."
.\"
.\"
.TP
.B update-all
This command updates all installed packages to the latest version. It does
not need a package list, so you just type:
.in +1i
.B fink update-all
.in -1i
.\"
.\"
.TP
\fBfink list\fP [\fIpackage\fP\|.\|.\|.]
This command produces a list of available packages, listing installation
status, the latest version and a short description. If you call it without
parameters, it will list all available packages. You can also pass a name or
a shell pattern, and fink will list all packages that match.

The first column displays the installation state with the following
meanings:

        not installed
    i   latest version is installed
   (i)  installed, but a newer version is available

Some usage examples:

\fBfink list\fP
.in +5
- list all packages
.in -5

\fBfink list bash\fP
.in +5
- check if bash is available and what version
.in -5

\fBfink list "gnome*"\fP
.in +5
- list all packages that start with 'gnome'
.in -5

The quotes in the last example are necessary to stop the shell from
interpreting the pattern itself.
.\"
.\"
.TP
\fBfink describe\fP \fIpackage\fP\|.\|.\|.
This command displays a description of the package you name on the command
line. Note that only a small part of the packages currently have a
description.

Aliases:
.BR desc ", " description ", " info "."
.\"
.\"
.TP
\fBfink fetch\fP \fIpackage\fP\|.\|.\|.
Downloads the named packages, but does not install it. This command will
download the tarballs even if they were downloaded before.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.B fink fetch-all
Downloads
.I all
package source files. Like fetch, this downloads the
tarballs even when they were downloaded before.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.B fink fetch-missing
Downloads
.I all
package source files. This command will only download files
that are not present on the system.
.\"
.\"
.TP
\fBfink build\fP \fIpackage\fP\|.\|.\|.
Builds a package, but does not install it. As usual, the source tarballs are
downloaded if they can not be found. The result of this command is an
installable .deb package file, which you can quickly install later with the
install command. This command will do nothing if the .deb already exists.
Note that dependencies are still 
.I installed,
not just built.
.\"
.\"
.TP
\fBfink rebuild\fP \fIpackage\fP\|.\|.\|.
Builds a package (like the
.B build
command), but ignores and overwrites the existing .deb file. If the
package is installed, the newly created .deb file will also be installed
in the system via
.BR dpkg "."
Very useful during package development.
.\"
.\"
.TP
\fBfink reinstall\fP \fIpackage\fP\|.\|.\|.
Same as install, but will install the package via
.B dpkg
even when it is already installed. You can use this when you accidentally
deleted package files or changed configuration files and want to get the
default settings back.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.B fink configure
Reruns the
.B fink
configuration process. This will let you change your mirror
sites and proxy settings, among others.

.SH FILES
.I @PREFIX@/etc/fink.conf
.RS
The system wide configuration file. You should not edit this file manually,
but rather use
.B fink configure
to change fink's settings.
