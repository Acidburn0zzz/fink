.Nm fink
.Nd a package management system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar command
.Op Ar package
.\"
.\"
.\" DESCRIPTION
.\"
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a package management system that aims to bring the full world
of GNU and other common Open Source software to Darwin and Mac OS X.
.Pp
With the help of
.Xr dpkg 8
it maintains a separate directory hierarchy. It
downloads original source releases, patches them if neccessary, configures
them for Darwin and compiles and installs them. The information about
available packages and the neccessary patches are included with this
distribution, everything else is downloaded off the Internet.

.\" COMMANDS
.\"
.\"
.Sh COMMANDS
.Nm
has several commands that work on packages. All of them need at least
one package name, and all can handle several package names at once. You can
specify just the package name (e.g. gimp), or a fully qualified name with a
version number (e.g. gimp-1.2.1 or gimp-1.2.1-3). Fink will automatically
choose the latest available version and revision when they are not
specified.
.\" List of commands
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Cm install Ar package...
The install command is used to install packages. It downloads, configure,
builds and installs the packages you name. It will also install required
dependencies automatically, but will ask you for confirmation before it
does so.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Cm update, enable, activate, use
.It Cm remove Ar package...
The remove command removes packages from the system by calling
.Ql "dpkg --remove".
The current implementation has several fundamental flaws. It only
works on packages Fink knows about (i.e. .info file is present). It doesn't
check dependencies. It makes one dpkg invocation per packages, thus not
allowing dpkg to reorder according to dependencies.
.Pp
The remove command only removes the actual package files, but leaves the .deb
compressed package file intact. This means that you can re-install the
package later without going through the compile process again. If you need
the disk space, you can remove the .deb from the 
.Pa @PREFIX@/fink/dists
tree.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Cm disable, deactivate, unuse, delete, purge
.It Cm update-all
This command updates all installed packages to the latest version. It does
not need a package list, so you just type:
.Dl Cm fink update-all
.It Cm list Op Ar package...
This command produces a list of available packages, listing installation
status, the latest version and a short description. If you call it without
parameters, it will list all available packages. You can also pass a name or
a shell pattern, and fink will list all packages that match.
.Pp
The first column displays the installation state with the following meanings:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It \ 
not installed
.It \ i
latest version is installed
.It (i)
installed, but a newer version is available
.El
.Pp
Some usage examples:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent
.It Cm fink list
list all packages
.It Cm fink list bash
check if bash is available and what version
.It Cm fink list Qq "gnome*"
list all packages that start with 'gnome'.
.El
.Pp
The quotes in the last example are necessary to stop the shell from
interpreting the pattern itself.
.It Cm describe Ar package...
This command displays a description of the package you name on the command
line. Note that only a small part of the packages currently have a
description.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Cm desc, description, info
.It Cm fetch Ar package...
Downloads the named packages, but does not install it. This command will
download the tarballs even if they were downloaded before.
.It Cm fetch-all
Downloads
.Em all
package source files. Like fetch, this downloads the
tarballs even when they were downloaded before.
.It Cm fetch-missing
Downloads
.Em all
package source files. This command will only download files
that are not present on the system.
.It Cm build Ar package...
Builds a package, but does not install it. As usual, the source tarballs are
downloaded if they can not be found. The result of this command is an
installable .deb package file, which you can quickly install later with the
install command. This command will do nothing if the .deb already exists.
Note that dependencies are still 
.Em installed,
not just built.
.It Cm rebuild Ar package...
Builds a package (like the
.Cm build
command), but ignores and overwrites the existing .deb file. If the
package is installed, the newly created .deb file will also be installed
in the system via
.Xr dpkg 8 .
Very useful during package development.
.It Cm reinstall Ar package...
Same as install, but will install the package via
.Xr dpkg 8
even when it is already installed. You can use this when you accidentally
deleted package files or changed configuration files and want to get the
default settings back.
.It Cm configure
Reruns the
.Nm
configuration process. This will let you change your mirror sites and
proxy settings, among others.
.It Cm selfupdate
This command automates the process of upgrading to a new
.Nm
release. It checks the
.Nm
website to see if a new version is available. It then downloads the package
descriptions and updates the core packages, including
.Nm
itself. This command can only upgrade to regular releases, but you can
use it to upgrade from a CVS version to a later regular release. It will
refuse to run if you have @PREFIX@/fink set up to get package descriptions
directly from CVS.

The system wide configuration file. You should not edit this file manually,
but rather use
