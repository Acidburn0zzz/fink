.Sh NAME
.Nm fink.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr fink 8
.Sh SYNOPSIS
@PREFIX@/etc/fink.conf
.\"
.\"
.\" DESCRIPTION
.\"
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When
.Xr fink 8
is initially installed it prompts you for the answers to some questions to set 
up your configuration file, such as which mirrors you want to use for 
downloading files and how to acquire super-user rights. You can re-run this 
process by calling the
.Cm fink configure
command. In order to set some options, you may need to edit your 
.Nm
by hand. In general, these options are meant for advanced users only.
.Pp
Your
.Nm
consists of multiple lines, in the format
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It OptionName: Value 
.El
.Pp
Options are one per line, and the option name is separated from its value by a : 
and a single space. The contents of value depends on the option, but it is 
normally either a boolean ("True" or "False"), a string, or a list of strings 
delimited by a space.  
For example: 
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It BooleanOption: True
.It StringOption: Something
.It ListOption: Option1 Option2 Option3

.\"
.Sh REQUIRED SETTINGS
Some of the settings in the fink.conf are mandatory. Without them Fink cannot to 
function properly. The following settings belong to this category. 
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Cm Basepath: Ar path 
Tells
.Nm fink
where it was installed. You should not change this value after installation, 
it will confuse
.Nm fink.
.El
.\"
.\"
.\" OPTIONAL USER SETTINGS
.\"
.\"
.Sh OPTIONAL USER SETTINGS
There are various optional settings which users can customize to change the 
behaviour of Fink. 
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Cm RootMethod: Ar su or sudo or none
For some operations,
.Nm fink
needs super user rights. Recognized values are
.Nm sudo
or
.Nm su. 
You can also set this to
.Nm none,
in which case you must run Fink as root yourself. The default value is
.Nm sudo
and in most cases it should not be changed. 
.It Cm Trees: Ar list of trees 
Available trees are:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It local/main      - any local packages you want to install
.It local/bootstrap - packages used in the installation of fink
.It stable/crypto   - stable cryptographic packages
.It stable/main     - other stable packages
.It unstable/crypto - unstable cryptographic packages
.It unstable/main   - other unstable packages 
.El
You may also add your own trees in the 
.Pa @PREFIX@/fink/dists
directory for your own purposes, 
but this is not necessary in most circumstances. The default trees are 
"local/main local/bootstrap stable/main". This list should be kept in sync with 
.Pa @PREFIX@/etc/apt/sources.list.
.It Cm Distribution: Ar 10.1, 10.2, 10.2-gcc3.3, or 10.3
Fink needs to know which version of Mac OS X you are running. Mac OS X 10.0 and earlier are not supported, and 10.1 is no longer supported by this version of fink. Mac OS X 10.2 is only still supported if the August 2003 Developer Tools update is installed. This field is set by running the
.Cm @PREFIX@/lib/fink/postinstall.pl
script. You should not need to alter this value manually. 
.It Cm FetchAltDir: Ar path 
Usually fink will store the sources it fetches in 
.Pa @PREFIX@/src.
Using this option, you can specify an alternate directory in which fink should look for downloaded source code. For example:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It FetchAltDir: /usr/src
.El
.It Cm Verbose: Ar a number from 0 to 3 
This option sets how much information Fink tells you about what it is doing. The 
values are: 
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It 0 - Quiet (don't show download stats)
.It 1 - Low (don't show tarballs being expanded) 
.It 2 - Medium (shows almost everything)
.It 3 - High (shows everything) 
.El
The default value is 1. 
.It Cm NoAutoIndex: Ar boolean 
Fink caches its package descripition files in 
.Pa @PREFIX@/var/db/fink.db
to save it having to read 
and parse them all every time it runs. Fink checks whether or not the package 
index needs to be updated unless this option is set to "True". It defaults to 
"False" and it is not recommended that you change it. 
If you do, you may need to manually run the
.Nm fink index 
command to update the index. 
.It Cm SelfUpdateNoCVS: Ar boolean 
The command fink selfupdate upgrades Fink package manager to the latest release. 
This option makes sure that the Concurrent Version System (CVS) is not used to 
achieve this when set to True. It is set automatically by the fink 
selfupdate-cvs command, so you should not need to change it manually. 
.It Cm Buildpath Ar path
Fink needs to create several temporary directories for each package it compiles from source. By default, they are placed in
.Pa @PREFIX@/src
but if you want them to be somewhere else, specify the path here.
See the descriptions of the
.Cm KeepRootDir
and
.Cm KeepBuildDir
fields later in this document for more information about these temporary directories.
.El
.\"
.\"
.\" DOWNLOAD SETTINGS
.\"
.\"
.Sh DOWNLOAD SETTINGS
There are various settings which influence the way Fink downloads package data. 
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Cm ProxyPassiveFTP: Ar boolean 
This option makes Fink use "passive" mode for FTP downloads. Some FTP server or 
network configurations require this option to be set to True. It is recommended 
that you leave this option on at all times since active FTP is deprecated. 
.It Cm ProxyFTP: Ar url 
If you use a FTP proxy then you should enter its address here, for example:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It ProxyFTP: ftp://yourhost.com:2121/ 
.El
Leave if blank if you do not use a FTP proxy. 
.It Cm ProxyHTTP: Ar url 
If you use a HTTP proxy then you should enter its address here, for example: 
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It ProxyHTTP: http://yourhost.com:3128/ 
.El
Leave if blank if you do not use a HTTP proxy. 
.It Cm DownloadMethod: Ar wget or curl or axel or axelautomirror 
Fink can use three different applications to download files from the Internet - 
.Nm wget,
.Nm curl,
or 
.Nm axel.
The value 
.Nm axelautomirror
uses an experimental mode of the 
.Xr axel 1
application which tries to determine the closest server that has a certain file. 
The use of axelautomirror is not recommended at this time. The default value is
.Nm curl.
The application you chose as DownloadMethod MUST be installed!
.It Cm SelfUpdateMethod: Ar point, rsync or cvs
.Xr fink 8
can use some different methods to update the package info files.
.Nm rsync
is the recommended setting, it uses
.Xr rsync 1
to download only modified files in the trees that you have enabled. Note that if you have changed or added to files in the stable or unstable trees, using rsync will delete them. Make a backup first.
.Nm cvs
will download using anonymous or :ext:
.Xr cvs 1
access from the fink repository. This has the disadvantage that cvs can not switch mirrors, if the server is unavailable you will not be able to update.
.Nm point
will download only the latest released version of the packages. It is not recommended as your packages may be quite out of date.
.It Cm UseBinaryDist: Ar boolean
Causes fink to try to download pre-compiled binary packages from the binary 
distribution if available and if deb is not already on the system.
Passing
.Cm fink
the
.Cm -b
flag has the same effect, but only operates on that single
.Cm fink
invocation.  Passing
.Cm fink
the
.Cm --no-use-binary-dist
flag overrides this, and compiles from source for that single
.Cm fink
invocation.
.Pp
Note that this mode instructs Fink to download the version it wants if
that version is available for download; it does not cause Fink to
choose a version based on its binary availability.
.El
.\"
.\"
.\" MIRROR SETTINGS
.\"
.\"
.Sh MIRROR SETTINGS
Getting software from the Internet can be tedious thing and often downloads are 
not as fast as we would like them to be. Mirror servers host copies of files 
available on other servers, but may have a faster connection to the Internet or 
be geographically closer to you, thus enabling you to download files faster. 
They also help reduce load on busy primary servers, for example ftp.gnu.org, and 
they provide an alternative should one
server not be reachable.
.Pp
In order for Fink to pick the best mirror for you, you must tell it which 
continent and which country you reside in. If downloads from one server fail, it 
will prompt you if you want to retry from the same mirror, a different mirror in 
the same country or continent, or a different mirror anywhere in the world. 
.Pp
.Nm
holds settings about which mirrors you would like to use. 
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Cm MirrorContinent: Ar three letter code 
You should change this value using the
.Nm fink configure
command. The three letter code is one found in 
.Pa @PREFIX@/lib/fink/mirror/_keys.
For example, if you live in europe: 
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It MirrorContinent: eur
.El
.It Cm MirrorCountry: Ar six letter code 
You should change this value using the
.Nm fink configure
command. The three letter code is one found in 
.Pa @PREFIX@/lib/fink/mirror/_keys.
For example, if you live in Austria: 
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It MirrorCountry: eur-AT 
.El
.It Cm MirrorOrder: Ar MasterFirst or MasterLast or MasterNever or ClosestFirst
Fink supports 'Master' mirrors, which are mirrored repositories of the source
tarballs for all Fink packages. The advantage of using the Master mirror set is that 
the source download URLs will never break. Users can choose to use 
these mirrors which are maintained by the Fink team, or to use only the original 
source URLs and external mirror sites such as the gnome, KDE, and debian mirror sites.
Additionally users can choose to combine the two sets, which are then searched in proximity order, as 
documented above. When using the MasterFirst or MasterLast options, the user can 'skip ahead' 
to the Master (or non Master) set if a download fails. The options are:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It MasterFirst - Search "Master" source mirrors first.
.It MasterLast - Search "Master" source mirrors last.
.It MasterNever - Never use "Master" source mirrors.
.It ClosestFirst - Search closest source mirrors first (combine all mirrors into one set).
.El	
.It Cm Mirror-rsync:
When doing 'selfupdate' with the SelfupdateMethod set to rsync, this is the rsync url to sync from.  This should be an anonymous rsync url, pointing to a directory which contains all the fink Distrubutions and Trees.

Some options in
.Nm
are only useful to developers. We do not recommend that conventional Fink users modify them. The following options
fall into this category.
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Cm KeepRootDir: Ar boolean
Causes Fink not to delete the
.Pa @PREFIX@/src/root-[name]-[version]-[revision]
directory after building a package. Defaults to false. 
Be careful, this option can fill your hard-disk quickly! 
Passing
.Cm fink
the
.Cm -K
flag has the same effect, but only operates on that single
.Cm fink
invocation.
.It Cm KeepBuildDir: Ar boolean 
Causes Fink not to delete the
.Pa @PREFIX@/src/[name]-[version]-[revision]
directory after building a package. Defaults to false. 
Be careful, this option can fill your hard-disk quickly! 
Passing
.Cm fink
the
.Cm -k
flag has the same effect, but only operates on that single
.Cm fink
invocation.

There are some other options which may be useful, but require some knowledge to get right.
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Cm MatchPackageRegEx: Ar regex
Causes
.Nm fink
not to ask which package to install if one (and only one) of the choices matches
the perl Regular Expression given here.
Example:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It MatchPackageRegEx: (.*-ssl$|^xfree86$|^xfree86-shlibs$)
.El
will match packages ending in '-ssl', and will match 'xfree86' and 'xfree86-shlibs' exactly.
.It Cm CCacheDir: Ar path
If the Fink package ccache-default is installed, the cache files it makes
while building Fink packages will be placed here. Defaults to 
.Pa @PREFIX@/var/ccache.
If set to
.Nm none, 
.Nm fink
will not set the
.Ev CCACHE_DIR
environment variable and ccache will use 
.Pa $HOME/.ccache, 
potentially putting root-owned files into your home directory.
.It Cm NotifyPlugin: Ar plugin
Specify a notification plugin to tell you when packages have been installed/uninstalled.
Defaults to
.Pa Growl
(requires Mac::Growl to operate).  Other plugins can be found in the
@PREFIX@/lib/perl5/Fink/Notify directory.
