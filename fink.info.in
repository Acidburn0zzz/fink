Description: The Fink package manager
DescPackaging: <<
 Must put "make test" before "./setup.sh %p", because make test runs
 the setup script itself, but pointed at the testing directory.
 The second run of setup.sh properly points fink at the installed
 configuration file.

 Had to make test-simple-pm, test-harness-pm, and file-spec-pm into
 Essential packages so that things are built in the right order
 during bootstrap or upgrades.
<<
DescDetail: <<
fink is the Fink project's package manager. It is responsible for
downloading and compiling source and building binary packages from
it. Binary package handling is then delegated to dpkg.
