CompileScript: make
InstallScript: sudo make install
CommentPort: Doesn't use autoconf, just a Darwin-specific
 Makefile. Must be installed as root - it will try to use sudo.
CommentStow: The library and the include file are actually installed
 in /usr/local, so that they can always be found by the compiler
 without -L or -I options. Sorry for the mess. Future versions of
 Darwin won't need this thing...
