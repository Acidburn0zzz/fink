Revision: 2
Source: gnu
UsesGettext: true
InstallScript: make install prefix=%i
 mv %i/bin/rm %i/bin/rm.fileutils
CommentPort: Uses autoconf. Seems to work fine. Someone should test
 the more exotic commands like mknod.
 .
 rm is broken - rm -rf doesn't always remove all files. Disabled by
 renaming for now.
