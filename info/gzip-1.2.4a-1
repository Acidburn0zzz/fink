Package: gzip
Version: 1.2.4a
Revision: 1
Source: gnu
CommentPort: Uses autoconf. Works fine. TODO: add links from gzcat to
 gzip, from zless to zmore. Dito for manpages.
CommentStow: The shellscripts hardcode the stow path. However, this is
 only to make sure they find the gzip binary, so it doesn't hurt.
