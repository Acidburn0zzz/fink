CommentPort: The configure script looks for the curses functions in the
 libraries libxcurses, libncurses and libcurses. Darwin / Mac OS X doesn't
 have any of these libraries because curses support is built into the libc.
 The configure script fails to detect this. I had to hack it to get it to
 work. Note that the configure script for less 340 (distributed with
 Darwin and Mac OS X) doesn't have this flaw...
CommentStow: No issues known.
