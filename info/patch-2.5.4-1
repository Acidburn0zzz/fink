Package: patch
Version: 2.5.4
Revision: 1
Source: gnu
UpdateConfigGuess: true
Patch: %f.patch
CommentPort: Uses autoconf and checks the host type - the usual
 fix. Tries to use a function called setmode() which is supposed to
 something else than the setmode(3) in *BSD. The patch removes the
 define from config.hin (and thus from config.h).
CommentStow: No issues.
