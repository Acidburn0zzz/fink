Package: stow
Version: 1.3.2
Revision: 1
Essential: yes
Source: gnu
Comment: This package must be installed before all other packages,
 because stow is used to manage the fink tree. stow is actually just a
 simple perl script, so this is no problem.
CommentPort: Uses autoconf. Requires perl, which is preinstalled on
 Mac OS X.
CommentStow: stow works fine with stow :-)
