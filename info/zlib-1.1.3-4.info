 The patch makes sure that z_off_t is always defined as long. Without
 the patch, zconf.h defines it as long (4 bytes) or off_t (8 bytes on
 Darwin), depending on whether HAVE_STDLIB_H is defined. This led to
 serious compatibility problems with the shared library. Apple's
 libz.dylib also a 4 byte type.
