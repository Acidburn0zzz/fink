Description: The Debian package manager (bootstrap package)
DescDetail: <<
dpkg installs and removes binary packages; it is the base of the
distribution. This package also contains some helper programs. This
package does not build dselect and thus doesn't require ncurses. It is
intended to be used during bootstrap.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses autoconf. Needs fixes to use the right architecture,
disable code that uses unimplemented functions on Darwin, work around
a bug related to partial read()'s, put everything into DESTDIR and
other stuff.
