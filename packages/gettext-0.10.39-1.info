Description: Localization support
DescDetail: <<
The gettext package provides some of the i18n and l10n support used by
many GNU programs but missing from the Darwin C library.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses libtool 1.4; may need a patch for Mac OS X 10.1.

Now again deliberately avoids using iconv() because libiconv causes
build problems with various packages.

Also needs help to link against the right copy of the library.

charset.alias is deleted because it is empty on Darwin anyway and
causes unnecessary conflicts between packages.
