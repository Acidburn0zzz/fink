Package: ncurses
Version: 5.2
Revision: 3
Source: gnu
Essential: yes
Depends: base-files
Patch: %f.patch
ConfigureParams: --without-cxx-binding --without-ada --with-shared --without-debug --disable-termcap --mandir=%p/share/man
SetCFLAGS: -traditional-cpp
InstallScript: make install DESTDIR=%d DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib
CommentPort: Needs heavy hacking to build shared libraries. The
 -traditional-cpp is not strictly needed, but gets rid of the myriad
 of bogus error messages. Also needs a small patch for
 case-insensitive file systems.

 Effects on other packages have not been tested.
