Description: Full-screen ascii drawing library
DescPort: <<
Needs heavy hacking to build shared libraries. The -no-cpp-precomp is
not strictly needed, but gets rid of the myriad of bogus error
messages. Also needs a small patch for case-insensitive file systems.

Effects on other packages have not been tested.
