TMPFILE=`/usr/bin/mktemp /tmp/resu.XXXXXX`

# Run a login shell to see whether the fink paths are already set up.
do_login_test

# Look whether @PREFIX@/sbin was in the PATH. 
# TODO: Test for other sensible things, too. 
if grep @PREFIX@/sbin $TMPFILE >/dev/null 2>&1 ; then
    # Yes: already set up
    echo 
    echo Your environment seems to be correctly
    echo set up for Fink already.
    echo
else
    # No: we need to do something
    eval `grep LOGINSHELL $TMPFILE`
